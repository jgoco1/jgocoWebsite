    <p>In this course I worked in a group of 5 to develop a game to raise awareness of deforestation. The game was a simple idle game similar to cookie clicker which had the user watering and growing trees. Other team members were Kate Martinez, Michael Maiden, Agransh Srivastava, and Shane Taylor</p>
